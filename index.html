         <h3>Martin Garrix</h3>
         <h4>High On Life</h4>
         <p>“High On Life” tells a story of living the fast life with either a friend or a lover, though the lyrics leave this open to interpretation. First publicly unveiled at his last Tomorrowland 2018 set for the festival’s second weekend and released shortly thereafter, the song was first announced in an Instagram post four days prior to the song’s release.

         <h3>Martin Garrix</h3>
         <h4>Burn Out</h4>
         <p>"This song was first known as “Evolve”, when it was first premiered. Although release of song was hoped, Martin said it will never be released.
         However at Tomorrowland 2018, he played the song alongside Justin Mylo on the STMPD RCRDS stage, with lyrics added- instead of a mash up between “Feel so close” by Calvin Harris."

         <h3>Martin Garrix</h3>
         <h4>Access</h4>
         <p>“Access” marks the fourth release from Martin Garrix’s 2018 EP, BY LAW.

         Though it was premiered at Ultra Music Festival 2017 in Miami, Access was actually previewed by Martin himself a month earlier through a YouTube live. He notes at the end that he “might change everything and just keep the melodies,” which ended up not being the case."

         <h3>Martin Garrix</h3>
         <h4>Latency</h4>
         <p>“Latency has the distinct electric sound he has featured in his other tracks. Right from the start, this song bumps so well. It takes you on a journey to the drop, which contains a massive bassline. I can bet you the drop will be stuck in your head for the rest of the day. It contains those electric elements from other hits of his like Byte and Tremor.”
